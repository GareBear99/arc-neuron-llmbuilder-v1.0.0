## Before you ask

Most questions are already answered in one of these documents:

- **[README.md](./README.md)** — overview and current state
- **[QUICKSTART.md](./QUICKSTART.md)** — 10-minute tour
- **[USAGE.md](./USAGE.md)** — complete command reference
- **[FAQ.md](./FAQ.md)** — 20+ searchable questions
- **[EXAMPLES.md](./EXAMPLES.md)** — 10 runnable recipes
- **[GLOSSARY.md](./GLOSSARY.md)** — every ARC-specific term
- **[PROOF.md](./PROOF.md)** — every claim with a verification command

## First-run diagnostics

```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/ -q                   # should report 87 passed
python3 scripts/ops/benchmark_omnibinary.py   # Omnibinary PASS
python3 scripts/ops/demo_proof_workflow.py    # 9/9 steps green
make verify-store                             # Omnibinary live-store integrity
```

If any of these fail, include the output when you ask for help.

  - PRs that preserve all ten governance invariants.

## Supporting the project

If you rely on ARC-Neuron LLMBuilder or any of the seven ARC ecosystem repos in your work:

- **GitHub Sponsors:** [github.com/sponsors/GareBear99](https://github.com/sponsors/GareBear99)
- **Buy Me a Coffee:** [buymeacoffee.com/garebear99](https://buymeacoffee.com/garebear99)

Support funds maintenance time across the whole ecosystem, not just this repo.
