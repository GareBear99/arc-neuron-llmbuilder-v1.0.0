## Intended use

**Primary use case**: reference incumbent for the ARC-Neuron governed promotion lane. Demonstrates that the canonical conversation pipeline + Gate v2 + floor model can produce lawful, reproducible model growth from conversation-harvested training data.

**Secondary use case**: benchmark reference for candidate models trained by downstream users. Any new candidate must clear the regression floor locked from this model to be promoted.

**Out of scope**:
- Natural conversation at frontier LLM quality — this is a ~0.18M parameter model; use an external adapter (`llama_cpp_http`, `command`) for real conversational quality.
- Safety-sensitive deployments — the governance gate checks capability + regression, not alignment or safety.
- Any task that requires tokens broader than byte-level encoding — this model cannot leverage subword patterns.

## Training data

**Total records**: 762 exemplar records (114 more than the prior incumbent `arc_governed_v5` which had 648).

Sources:
- Base corpus: repo text from `datasets/*/*.jsonl` plus Python/Markdown/YAML files under 500 KB cap.
- SFT additions:
  - `v4_headroom_reasoning.jsonl` (17 records) — reasoning, critique, lexical accuracy, archive reasoning
  - `v5_extension_reasoning.jsonl` (8 records) — governance, promotion gate, lexical accuracy
  - **Conversation harvest** (30 records) — direct conversation output from the canonical pipeline driven by 30 varied prompts covering reasoning, critique, continuity, reflection, out_of_domain, instruction_following, system_spine, archive_reasoning, and lexical_accuracy
  - Pipeline SFT (39 records) — auto-tagged training-eligible records from the same conversations
  - Terminology SFT (45 records) — from the language module's approved terms
- Prior corpora: everything already baked into v5 (648 records).

**Corpus hash**: see `reports/arc_native_train_arc_governed_v6_conversation.json` for the SHA-256 of the training byte-stream.

**Provenance**: every conversation-harvested record carries receipt ID, turn ID, session ID, and UTC timestamp from the canonical pipeline run.

## Evaluation

**Benchmark**: 165-task suite across 16 capability families.

**Overall weighted score**: `0.7333` (0 failures out of 165 tasks).

**Per-capability breakdown**:

| Capability | Score | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| reasoning | 1.0000 | at ceiling |
| planning | 1.0000 | at ceiling |
| compression | 1.0000 | at ceiling |
| paraphrase_stability | 0.8666 | |
| calibration | 0.8333 | |
| quantization_retention | 0.8333 | strong gain over v5 (0.667) |
| english_understanding | 0.7500 | |
| critique | 0.7500 | |
| out_of_domain | 0.7500 | strong gain over v5 (0.667) |
| repair | 0.6667 | |
| intelligence | 0.5972 | |
| instruction_following | 0.5833 | |
| continuity | 0.5833 | |
| reflection | 0.5667 | gain over v5 (0.500) |
| arc_neuron_small_v2 | 0.5185 | |
| arc_neuron_base | 0.4333 | regression from v5 (0.5333), below violation threshold |

**Comparison to baseline**:
- `arc_governed_v2` rescored on same 165-task set: 0.6121 → v6_conversation: 0.7333 (**+16.5% relative**)
- `arc_governed_v5`: 0.7169 → v6_conversation: 0.7333 (**+0.0164 absolute**)

**Gate v2 decision receipt**: `reports/promotion_decision.json` at time of promotion — promoted with zero regression violations and zero floor violations.

## Safety and limitations

1. **Small model limitations.** At ~0.18M parameters on byte-level tokenization, the model cannot produce novel natural-language reasoning beyond what exemplar retrieval surfaces from its training corpus. Responses are effectively best-match retrievals with light paraphrasing.

2. **Exemplar retrieval, not generation.** Benchmark responses use the `ExemplarAdapter` which performs cosine retrieval over training records. The underlying transformer weights are real but their generative quality at this scale is limited.

3. **Doctrine-specific vocabulary.** The model has high fluency within the ARC governance doctrine (Gate v2, floor model, Arc-RAR, Omnibinary, receipts, lineage) and low fluency outside that domain. It is not a general-purpose assistant.

4. **No safety filtering.** Gate v2 is a capability + regression gate. This model has not been aligned for harmlessness, honesty, or helpfulness in the RLHF sense. Production deployments should add a safety layer at the adapter boundary.

5. **English-only.** No multilingual capability.

## Restoration

To restore this model after a future incumbent:

```python
from runtime.learning_spine import read_arc_rar_manifest
from pathlib import Path
import zipfile, shutil

bundle = Path("artifacts/archives/arc-rar-arc_governed_v6_conversation-2acf171e.arcrar.zip")
with zipfile.ZipFile(bundle) as z:
    z.extractall("restore/arc_governed_v6_conversation/")

# Inspect the manifest
mf = read_arc_rar_manifest(bundle)
print(f"files in bundle: {mf['file_count']}")

# Move the exemplar artifact back into exports/
shutil.copy(
    "restore/arc_governed_v6_conversation/exemplar_model.json",
    "exports/candidates/arc_governed_v6_conversation_restored/exemplar_train/exemplar_model.json",
)
```

The restored exemplar can be registered via the standard benchmark and gate path for verification that the restore is lossless.
