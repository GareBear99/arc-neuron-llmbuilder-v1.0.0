# ARC-Neuron LLMBuilder

**A governed local AI build-and-memory system — train small language models, measure them, promote the better ones through a regression-aware gate, and keep every decision restorable.**

> Local-first. Evidence-backed. Promotion-gated. Rollback-safe. Part of the seven-repo ARC ecosystem.

> 🖥️ **Built, tested, and verified on a 2012 Intel Mac running macOS Catalina.** If it runs there, it runs anywhere. The three governed promotions, the 87-test suite, the Omnibinary throughput numbers, and the 9-step proof workflow were all produced on 12-year-old consumer hardware with a pre-Retina Intel CPU. No GPU. No cloud. No accelerator. Just Python and a lot of discipline.

## 🤖 Live deployment — continuous-learning AI operative

**A real AI operative feeds this corpus every day.** The [ARC GitHub AI Operator](https://github.com/GareBear99/gh-ai-operator) answers code-review issues on the [Portfolio](https://github.com/GareBear99/Portfolio) via [Cloudflare Workers AI](https://github.com/GareBear99/gh-ai-operator/blob/main/cloudflare/README.md), posts a verdict back on the issue, and emits every production review as a supervised training example in this repo's seed-examples schema. The nightly workflow `ingest-operator-reviews.yml` pulls those artifacts into `data/critique/operator_reviews.jsonl`, dedupes by id, and bumps human-correction records (from Portfolio Follow-up issues) by +0.05 confidence so Gate v2 weights them higher.

Nothing auto-promotes to the curated `seed_examples.jsonl` — ingested data stays in a separate shard so a human curator keeps the final call. Full pipeline: [docs/LIVE_DEPLOYMENT_LEARNING.md](./docs/LIVE_DEPLOYMENT_LEARNING.md). Activation is one secret: `OPERATOR_READ_TOKEN` (PAT with `Actions: Read` on `GareBear99/gh-ai-operator`).

**Live-run evidence**: [docs/OPERATOR_EVIDENCE.md](./docs/OPERATOR_EVIDENCE.md) — chronological log of real runs. First entry (FreeEQ8, Portfolio issue #1) documents the verdict, the JSONL shape, and the ingest manifest with no code changes required to accept it.

<a id="what-this-is"></a>
## What this is

ARC-Neuron LLMBuilder is a local-first cognition lab that treats a language model as one artifact inside a **governed lifecycle**. You don't just train a model — you train a candidate, measure it, compare it to the current incumbent, and promote it only if it genuinely improves without regressing on guarded capabilities. Every decision leaves receipts. Every candidate is restorable. Every archive ties back to the source truth through an indexed binary ledger.

The system ships with a working transformer family (ARC-Neuron Tiny and Small), a retrieval-based exemplar adapter, a canonical conversation pipeline, draft→critique→revise reflection, automatic terminology absorption from conversation, and a regression-aware promotion gate.

**Doctrine closed in v1.0.0-governed:** conversation grows the brain, not just the memory. Three governed promotions in a row have been recorded, the last one (`arc_governed_v6_conversation`) trained entirely from a corpus the canonical conversation pipeline harvested itself.

---

## 🌐 The ARC Ecosystem

ARC-Neuron LLMBuilder is **one of seven repositories** in the ARC governed-AI ecosystem. Each repo owns a single frozen role; together they form a local-first AI operating system with full lineage, receipts, and rollback.

Brief tour of each (full writeups in [ECOSYSTEM.md](./ECOSYSTEM.md)):

### [ARC-Core](https://github.com/GareBear99/ARC-Core) — authoritative event-and-receipt engine
The root authority. Every state change across the system is modeled as an event with a proposal, evidence, an authority, a receipt, and a SHA-256 hash. This is how the ecosystem proves *something actually happened*. It also carries the signal-intelligence event-graph primitives (cases, watchlists, risk scoring) that give operators a structured way to organize investigations over the event stream.

### [arc-lucifer-cleanroom-runtime](https://github.com/GareBear99/arc-lucifer-cleanroom-runtime) — deterministic execution kernel
The deterministic shell the rest of the system eventually runs inside. Event-sourced `KernelEngine` with an append-only log, policy evaluation, branch planning, point-in-time `state_at(event_id)` replay, SQLite backup, directive continuity across restarts. LLMs are stochastic; Cleanroom is the deterministic substrate that makes the rest of the system reproducible.

### [arc-cognition-core](https://github.com/GareBear99/arc-cognition-core) — cognition build-and-benchmark lab
The upstream home of the cognition doctrine: candidate shaping (SFT / preference / merge / export), GGUF-oriented evaluation, promotion gate v1 (what LLMBuilder's Gate v2 evolved from), MCP-style tool descriptors, run manifests, experiment tracking, release bundle generation. Defines what "a cognition candidate" means.

### [arc-language-module](https://github.com/GareBear99/arc-language-module) — governed multilingual language backend
The authoritative store for what a word means, how it is spelled, what it maps to across languages, and where each of those facts came from. Governed ingestion with provenance + trust rank, readiness/gap states, self-fill orchestration with approval gates, contradiction arbitration, release pipelines with replayable snapshots. 40+ internal services. Treats words as first-class governed records, not strings.

### [omnibinary-runtime](https://github.com/GareBear99/omnibinary-runtime) — native-first binary intake and runtime ledger
Applies the receipt economy to binaries. Intake + classification + deterministic decoding of executables, libraries, GGUF weights, ANCF artifacts. Federated execution lanes (managed / native / DBT) each with their own policy and receipts. JIT via Cranelift and LLVM. Cache-integrity-before-speed policy. Rust crates: `obi-core`, `obi-cache`, `obi-intake`, `obi-jit-*`, `obi-lane-*`, `obi-receipts`, and more.

### [Arc-RAR](https://github.com/GareBear99/Arc-RAR) — governed archive and rollback
CLI-first archive manager with a native-app control surface (Linux GTK, macOS, Windows WinUI). Bundles are manifest-indexed and SHA-256-verified; the manifest is readable without extracting. Extraction is evidence-producing — every restore leaves a receipt. Automation crate, FFI crate, IPC crate for daemon mode. Any archived state is addressable by SHA-256; rollback is first-class, not a recovery special case.

### ARC-Neuron-LLMBuilder *(this repo)* — governed build loop
Assembly of the other six into a working train → benchmark → gate → archive → verify cycle. Canonical conversation pipeline, Gate v2 promotion, floor model, reflection loop, language absorption, OBIN v2 indexed ledger, Arc-RAR bundle packaging. Three governed promotions on record (v4, v5, v6_conversation). 87 tests. 165-task benchmark suite.

## 💡 What it does, in plain English

| You do | The system does |
|---|---|
| Talk to it | Records the conversation with a signed receipt, mirrors it into the Omnibinary indexed ledger, extracts terminology with provenance |
| Ask it to train a new model | Mines the accumulated SFT corpus, trains a byte-level transformer, exports `.pt` + `.gguf`, builds a retrieval exemplar artifact |
| Ask it to compare | Runs the candidate against the full 165-task benchmark, scores with the task-aware rubric, prints per-capability deltas |
| Ask it to promote | Applies Gate v2 (hard-reject floor, floor-model protection, regression ceilings), updates the scoreboard, bundles the candidate into an Arc-RAR archive |
| Ask it to roll back | Restores a prior incumbent from its bundle; the prior state is always addressable by SHA-256 |
| Ask it to prove itself | Runs `demo_proof_workflow.py` or `run_n_cycles.py` — every step produces a receipt |

python3 scripts/ops/benchmark_omnibinary.py   # measures the ledger
python3 scripts/ops/demo_proof_workflow.py    # 9-step end-to-end proof
```

### 3. Use the incumbent model

**Shortest possible — one line:**

```bash
python3 examples/hello.py "Critique a plan that ships without a rollback path."
```

**Full CLI equivalent:**

```bash
python3 scripts/execution/run_direct_candidate.py \
  --adapter exemplar \
  --artifact exports/candidates/arc_governed_v6_conversation/exemplar_train/exemplar_model.json \
  --prompt "Critique a plan that ships without a rollback path."
```

### 4. Train your own candidate

```bash
# Train a new candidate against the current corpus
python3 scripts/training/train_arc_native_candidate.py \
  --candidate my_candidate_v1 --tier small --steps 300

# Benchmark it
python3 scripts/execution/run_model_benchmarks.py \
  --adapter exemplar \
  --artifact exports/candidates/my_candidate_v1/exemplar_train/exemplar_model.json \
  --output results/my_candidate_v1_outputs.jsonl

# Score it
python3 scripts/execution/score_benchmark_outputs.py \
  --input results/my_candidate_v1_outputs.jsonl \
  --output results/my_candidate_v1_scored.json

# Submit to Gate v2 — promote, archive-only, or reject with reasons
python3 scripts/execution/promote_candidate.py \
  --scored results/my_candidate_v1_scored.json \
  --model-name my_candidate_v1 \
  --candidate my_candidate_v1
```

### 5. Run the full governed loop

```bash
make full-loop       # train → benchmark → score → gate → bundle → verify
make pipeline        # run one conversation through the canonical path
make verify-store    # check Omnibinary integrity
```

**Four layers, frozen roles**:

- **Language Module** — living truth spine. Stores terms with provenance, trust ranks, and contradiction flags. Grows from every conversation.
- **Runtime** — persistent operator shell. Canonical conversation pipeline, reflection loop, language absorption, continuity state.
- **Cognition Core** — build-and-benchmark lab. Native training, exemplar adapter, benchmark harness, scoring rubric, promotion gate.
- **Archive** — Arc-RAR bundles for restorable lineage. Omnibinary ledger for O(1) indexed event history. ANCF for canonical model artifacts.

## ⚖️ The governance doctrine

Every candidate must clear **Gate v2** before displacing an incumbent:

1. **Hard-reject floor** — `repair_success` ≥ 0.30, `failure_rate` ≤ 0.25
2. **Floor model check** — core capabilities cannot drop below the locked baseline (currently v6_conversation)
3. **Regression ceilings** — no guarded capability may drop more than its per-capability allowance vs the incumbent
4. **Beat the incumbent** on overall weighted score
5. **Non-promotable adapter filter** — heuristic/echo adapters can never become incumbents

Outcomes are one of: **promote**, **archive_only**, or **reject**. Every outcome produces a receipt. `archive_only` and `reject` never displace the current incumbent. `promote` bundles the winning candidate via Arc-RAR, preserving the full lineage.

## 📌 Status and scope

**What this is**: a local-first governed cognition lab and control plane for training, promoting, and archiving small language models with full lineage. The included native models (Tiny and Small) are reference tiers designed to prove the pipeline is real, not to compete with frontier LLMs.

**What this is not**: a frontier-scale LLM. The ARC-Neuron Tiny model is ~0.05M parameters. The Small model is ~0.18M parameters. They are deliberately small because the contribution here is the **governance**, not the raw brain.

**The shell is contender-grade. The brain is the research lane.** The adapter boundary is the integration point: you can plug any local GGUF runtime or HTTP-served model into the existing governance machinery via `adapters/command_adapter.py` or `adapters/llama_cpp_http_adapter.py`.

## ProtoSynth Integration PathARC-Neuron LLMBuilder v1

## ProtoSynth Integration Path

ARC-Neuron LLMBuilder v1 is designed to act as the cognition and model-building layer of the ARC ecosystem, while ProtoSynth provides the visual/spatial interface layer for exploring, projecting, and interacting with structured intelligence systems.

- **ARC-Neuron LLMBuilder v1 Release:**  
  https://github.com/GareBear99/arc-neuron-llmbuilder-v1.0.0

- **ProtoSynth Grid Engine:**  
  https://github.com/GareBear99/Proto-Synth_Grid_Engine

Together, these projects form a practical foundation for a local-first AI development loop

dataset preparation


- tokenizer and model training experiments


- benchmark and scoring workflows


- local-first model artifact generation


- reproducible evidence trails for model improvement


- groundwork for future GGUF/local runtime deployment


- ProtoSynth focuses on the front-facing visualization and interaction layer:


- 2D/3D-style grid projection


- node-based cognition visualization


- spatial organization of files, models, datasets, and systems


- visual “brain lab” style interaction


- future neural-map views for ARC-Neuron states, evals, and training progress


**Tandem Usage Vision**

The intended workflow is that LLMBuilder produces the intelligence artifacts, while ProtoSynth makes those artifacts visible, navigable, and interactive.
For example:


- training runs from LLMBuilder can be represented as ProtoSynth nodes


- datasets can appear as spatial clusters or voxel directories


- benchmark results can become live visual signals


- stronger model versions can be promoted visually through the grid


- failed runs can be archived, inspected, and compared


- future ARC-Neuron models can be connected to ProtoSynth as an embodied visual cognition layer


This creates a path toward a local AI workshop where the user is not just running scripts, but visually operating a reproducible intelligence system.
Long-Term ARC Stack Role

In the larger ARC ecosystem, the relationship can be understood as:

ARC-Neuron LLMBuilder = builds the brainProtoSynth = visualizes the brainARC Core = governs the brainArc-RAR = archives the brainOmnibinary = mirrors the brain 

stateCleanroom Runtime = safely executes the brain

This makes ARC-Neuron LLMBuilder v1 the first public cognition-building milestone, while ProtoSynth acts as the future spatial UI layer for inspecting and interacting with that cognition in a lightweight, local-first environment.

The v1 release should therefore be viewed not only as a standalone model-building repository, but as the backend foundation for a larger visual AI lab experience powered by ProtoSynth.

## 🎯 One-line verdict

**The machine is lawful. The measurement is honest. The loop grows a better brain on demand, preserves the prior one, rejects worse ones with attribution, and does so repeatedly.**
